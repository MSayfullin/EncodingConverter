Let's say it is approximately 40%.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n[v1.0](https://encodingconverter.codeplex.com/downloads/get/679223)\r\n\r\n## Licenses\r\n[The MIT License (MIT)](https://github.com/MSayfullin/EncodingConverter/blob/master/LICENSE)\r\n\r\nCharDetSharp  \r\n[Mozilla Public License 1.1](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
